# Reading data from a csv file
# You can read data from a CSV file using the `read_csv` function. By default, it assumes that the fields are comma-separated.

# We're going to be looking some cyclist data from Montr√©al. Here's the [original page](http://donnees.ville.montreal.qc.ca/dataset/velos-comptage) (in French), but it's already included in this repository. We're using the data from 2012.

# This dataset is a list of how many people were on 7 different bike paths in Montreal, each day.

broken_df = pd.read_csv(DATA_PATH, encoding="ISO-8859-1")

# TODO: please load the data with the Polars library (do not forget to import Polars at the top of the script) and call it pl_broken_df
pl_broken_df = pl.read_csv(DATA_PATH, encoding="ISO-8859-1")

# %%
# Look at the first 3 rows
broken_df[:3]

# TODO: do the same with your polars data frame, pl_broken_df
pl_broken_df.head(3)

# %%
# You'll notice that this is totally broken! `read_csv` has a bunch of options that will let us fix that, though. Here we'll

# * change the column separator to a `;`
# * Set the encoding to `'latin1'` (the default is `'utf8'`)
# * Parse the dates in the 'Date' column
# * Tell it that our dates have the day first instead of the month first
# * Set the index to be the 'Date' column

fixed_df = pd.read_csv(
    DATA_PATH,
    sep=";",
    encoding="latin1",
    parse_dates=["Date"],
    dayfirst=True,
    index_col="Date",
)
fixed_df[:3]

# TODO: do the same with polars
pl_fixed_df = pl.read_csv(
    DATA_PATH, separator=";", encoding="latin1", try_parse_dates=True
)

# Note that Polars does not have an index and that instead of NaN we have null values.

# %%
# Selecting a column
# When you read a CSV, you get a kind of object called a `DataFrame`, which is made up of rows and columns. You get columns out of a DataFrame the same way you get elements out of a dictionary.

# Here's an example:
fixed_df["Berri 1"]

# TODO: how would you do this with a Polars data frame?
pl_fixed_df.select(pl.col("Berri 1"))
# alternatively
pl_fixed_df.select("Berri 1")

# %%
# Plotting is quite easy in Pandas; with Polars data frames you might have to use the Seaborn library
fixed_df["Berri 1"].plot()

# TODO: how would you do this with a Polars data frame?
# This needs the package altair installed
pl_fixed_df.plot.line(x="Date", y="Berri 1")

# %%
# We can also plot all the columns just as easily. We'll make it a little bigger, too.
# You can see that it's more squished together, but all the bike paths behave basically the same -- if it's a bad day for cyclists, it's a bad day everywhere.

fixed_df.plot(figsize=(15, 10))

# TODO: how would you do this with a Polars data frame?
# This is not actually easily possible since Polars does not work with an index and hence, we cannot
# set the date column as an index and plot away.
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
for col in pl_fixed_df.columns:
    if col != "Date":
        sns.lineplot(data=pl_fixed_df, x="Date", y=col, label=col)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
